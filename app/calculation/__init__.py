# Import ABC (Abstract Base Class) and abstractmethod from Python's abc module.
# Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) allow us to define a contract for our subclasses, specifying 
# methods that they must implement. This helps in establishing a standard interface for 
# similar objects without enforcing specific details on how they should work.
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Import the Operation class from the app.operation module. 
# The Operation class is where our basic mathematical functions (e.g., addition, subtraction) are defined.
# Rather than implementing arithmetic logic within each calculation class, we encapsulate it in a 
# separate class to promote modularity. This makes it easier to modify or extend these functions independently.
